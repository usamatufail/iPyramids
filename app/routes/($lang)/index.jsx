        <br />
        <p className="text-[18px]">
          Hold on tight, because this goes deep. Sam was the guy doing the heavy lifting, busting his hump for a venture he thought was the
          real deal. On the flip side, Dylan was running scams that&apos;d make a street hustler blush. So, what&apos;s he been up to?
          <br />
          <br />
          Firstly, all those glowing articles you see about him in Forbes, Entrepreneur, Forbes and the like? Pure fiction — bought from a
          guy named &nbsp;

          </a>
          . Check him out yourself, the guy&apos;s got a whole{' '}
          <a href="https://topmags.io/" target="_blank" className="text-blue-950 underline">
            business
          </a>{' '}
          around selling PR. Yet Dylan tosses these &quot;credentials&quot; at every client like they&apos;re solid gold.
          <br />
          <br />
          Secondly, those massive Instagram numbers? Pure air. Courtesy of{' '}

          </a>
          , Dylan buys followers on the cheap and sells them at an insane markup. Heck, he&apos;s even warned about the damage this does by
          his so-called &quote;mentor&quote; Wes Watson. But does he care? Nope.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then, as if manipulating PR and social media wasn&apos;t enough, he&apos;s busy renting sports cars and models for a day to create
          an illusion of a life he doesn&apos;t live. All of this while squeezing clients dry and not paying his team a cent.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, let&apos;s call it what it is: Dylan was never about a joint vision or shared success. The guy&apos;s in it for himself,
          building a brand on a mountain of lies and leaving folks like Sam high and dry.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you&apos;re looking for genuine talent and transparency, get to know Sam. He&apos;s the real deal, no smoke and mirrors.
          <br />
